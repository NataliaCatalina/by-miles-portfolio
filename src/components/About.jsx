         As an experienced VFX Artist, 3D Freelancer and Animator, Iâ€™ve developed a broad skillset that has allowed me to contribute to a diverse set of projects. I actively maintain positive and collaborative working environments, and am most engaged in my work when it is at its most challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have worked on 3D animated films, kids TV shows, tentpole VFX films, and indie shorts. I am experienced in a wide range of software, including Maya, Houdini, Unreal Engine, Katana, Blender, Substance Painter, Nuke, DaVinci Resolve, and many more.

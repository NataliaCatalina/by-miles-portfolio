    '<p>My work on Flux Animation Studio&#039;s &quot;25 April&quot;, a comic-styled documentary of Gallipoli.<br />    I served as a Junior Animator on this film, delivering 3D character animation of feature quality. One of the interesting challenges I faced with this was the animation style, which utilized a low frame rate and an emphasis on static holds to sell the comic book aesthetic.<br />    Credit to Flux Animation Studios for the production.<br />    Music credit to Ladysmith Black Mambazo - &quot;Rain, Rain, Beautiful Rain&quot;<br />    All 3D Character Animation by Miles Wilson</p>'
